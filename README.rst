StarlingX Project
=================

StarlingX is a fully featured and high performance Edge Cloud software stack
that is based on the `Wind RiverÂ® Titanium Cloud
<https://www.windriver.com/products/titanium-cloud/>`_ R5 product. Intel and
Wind River have jointly open sourced this software and we invite you to
download, build, install, and run it.

Wind River Titanium Cloud was originally built on open source components, that
were then extended and hardened to meet critical infrastructure requirements,
including: high availability, fault management, and performance management.
This software provides numerous features and capabilities to enable 24/7
operation of mission critical applications.

The StarlingX project opens all of these enhancements to the open source
community. Please join us as we build the infrastructure stack for Edge
Computing.
