====================================================
Image API v2 Titanium extensions
====================================================

Titanium extensions to the OpenStack Image API to support additional
properties on images for customizing migration behaviour, supporting raw
cached images in ceph cluster, disabling VM auto-recovery and indicating
the backend where the image is stored.

The typical port used for the Image REST API is 9292. However, proper
technique would be to look up the image/glance service endpoint in
Keystone.

The Image entity is extended by Titanium Cloud to have additional
properties on images for customizing migration behaviour, supporting raw
cached images in ceph cluster, disabling VM auto-recovery and indicating
the backend where the image is stored.
